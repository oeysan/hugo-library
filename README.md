# Hugo Library

A way to create a [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library for your university, 
department, or research group using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and 
[*c2z4uni*](https://oeysan.github.io/c2z4uni/).

See [c2z4inn](https://oeysan.github.io/c2z4inn/) for a living example of the
project.

## Current features

 * Static and dynamic pages
 * Vanilla JavaScript and JSON
 * [pako](https://github.com/nodeca/pako) high speed zlib
 * [line awesome](https://icons8.com/line-awesome) modern line icons
 * [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) charting library
 * i18n (currently Norwegian and English)

# Versioning (0.2.0)

The theme uses a semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch), where breaking changes
may occur at both new major and minor versions but not with patches. Thus, Hugo
will throw an error if the version in `config.yaml` does not equal 0.2.x.
